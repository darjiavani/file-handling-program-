## 📘 Internship Tasks

### Task 1 – File Handling Program
In this task, a C program is developed to perform basic file operations such as:
- Creating a file  
- Writing data into a file  
- Reading data from a file  
- Appending new data  

This task helped in understanding how files are handled in C using standard library functions.

### Task 2 – Linked List Implementation
This task involves implementing a **singly linked list** using C.  
The program supports the following operations:
- Insertion of nodes  
- Deletion of nodes  
- Traversal of the linked list  

It demonstrates the use of structures, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

### Task 3 – Lexical Analyzer (Compiler Design Basics)
A simple lexical analyzer is implemented to analyze an input file and identify:
- Keywords  
- Identifiers  
- Operators  

This task provides an introduction to compiler design concepts, especially the lexical analysis phase.

### Task 4 – Data Compression Tool
In this task, a basic **data compression and decompression tool** is created using the  
**Run Length Encoding (RLE)** algorithm.

The program compresses repeated characters and can also restore the original data.
